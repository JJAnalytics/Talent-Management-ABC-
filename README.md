## Insights & Recommendations

•	The employment data reveals a gender imbalance within the company. Specifically, 40.33% of the workforce is comprised of women, while 59.67% is made up of men.                                                                                                               
  Create a structured mentorship program where female employees can be paired with experienced female or male mentors. This can be based on career aspirations, skills development, or areas where employees want guidance.

•	The company may prioritise hiring individuals with advanced educational backgrounds.

  Offer opportunities to those without traditional advanced degrees to upskill through internal training programs or partnerships with educational institutions.

## Limitations & Potential Solutions

•	Unconscious Bias in Hiring and Promotions.
  Implement bias-free recruitment processes by removing gender-specific information from resumes and standardised interview questions.
  Provide unconscious bias training for hiring managers and decision-makers to promote awareness and reduce bias in evaluating candidates.

•	Narrowing the Talent Pool.
  Broaden the criteria for hiring by considering candidates with diverse educational backgrounds, including vocational training, certifications, or relevant work experience. 
  Implement a holistic recruitment process that values skills and practical knowledge alongside formal education.

## Summary

The company’s workforce shows a gender imbalance, with 40.33% women and 59.67% men. To address this, a mentorship program can be established, pairing female employees with both male and female mentors to support career growth and skills development. Additionally, while the company may prioritise hiring individuals with advanced degrees, it can offer upskilling opportunities for those without such qualifications through internal training programs or partnerships with educational institutions.
